<h1>
Organize the chaos and Focus on what matters.
</h1>
<p class="jumbo">
Early stage technology companies have a problem. Founders spread their energy across too many disciplines and tasks, leaving their efforts less effective than they could be. The cause of this problem is poor focus. It's difficult to figure out what's most important within the context of our own business. When we constantly deal with the day-to-day details, we get pulled in many directions, and it's hard to say no. When founders spend time on strategy at regular intervals, however, the chaos becomes easier to manage and focus makes us more effective.

<h2>
Lean App Foundation
</h2>
<p>
Proper focus begins with the right foundation. Everything we do should be anchored to a set of decisions which provide direction and guidance. This foundation takes just a little thought up front, and pays big returns down the road.
</p>
<p>
For early stage technology companies, Lean App Foundation is the process that not only defines what should get built, but more importantly why and for whom specifically we’re building. Your successful MVP needs to find that elusive intersection between the three factors; business viability, product appeal, and technical feasibility.
</p>\
<p>
To verify that you’ve found the magic spot, you need to not only find people who want your solution, but are also willing to pay the price you have in mind (free solutions make for terrible business models).
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, you’ll need to understand the technical ins and outs of your proposed solution. Founders must answer three specific questions:
</p>
<p>
Do you have a viable business idea?
Does your solution appeal to enough people?
Is the solution technically feasible (within your budget)?
</p>
<p>
Lean App Foundation is the most effective way to make sure the money will go to the right places at the right time. To get started, download the  toolkit here.

<h3>
Business Viability
</h3>
<p>
Discover your company’s purpose, understand why it matters, and learn how it gets used within the context of your startup. Then, crystallize your business idea with our customized version of the lean canvas for apps, and see a clear vision with all the important decisions on a single page.
</p>
<h3>
Customers & Validation
</h3>
<p>
Identify where your target customers and early adopters are coming from and how you will access them to seed your marketing channels. Learn about the wrong way and the right way to interview target customers, get a script for in-person interviews, and discover resources to conduct online surveys.
</p>
<h3>
Technical Feasibility
</h3>
<p>
Get a handle on how the solution will come together, and craft a plan for any tricky technical pieces with advice from the experts.
</p>
<p>
Avoid a lengthy plan & use the one-page template
Identify the key components of a plan
Crystallize your idea with an easy-to-use document
Step-by-step docs
Blank forms & suggested resources
Discover your target customers
Understand early adopters
Learn how to find your customers for feedback
Prepare for interviews with a step-by-step process
Learn how marketing ties in before you start building
Follow along with examples to make the journey easy
</p>
<p>
After you’ve validated the plan with potential customers and defined a feature roadmap, you’ll be in a position to start coding work (which we can help with too). This foundational stage is terribly important when building an app, and it doesn’t have to take all that long if you know the right questions to answer.
