Put some experienced muscle behind your hustle.

As a non-technical entrepreneur, finding a good technology partner is grueling. You have the  domain expertise and customer connections, but the tech pieces are a black box. It seems as though every technology expert you contact has a different solution and different pricing in mind, and you don't know who to trust. We're here to help. Ease your pain with our proven experience, a better relationship, and Lean methodologies that focus on traction and reward your hustle.

<h2>
A Venture Partnership Is...
</h2>
<p>
A venture partnership is our term for an early-stage company that enters into a partnership with us to build a technology company. We all invest effort, cash, or both while sharing company equity to create an amazing product together. We use a simple operating agreement to govern the relationship, and we offer equity buy-back guarantees to make sure founders get to keep the lion's share of equity in their pocket.
</p>
<p>
We like the term venture partnership when compared with "ventures" or "partners". We're not professional investors offering convertible notes or SAFE agreements like venture firms. Nor are we service providers that over-use the term partner to describe work-for-hire relationships. Instead, we invest time & money while sharing risk with company founders to become true partners in a business venture. In doing so, we provide the tech and business experience, and we leverage founder connections and hustle to get a win for everyone.
</p>
<p>
Although we use the term technology company, the core competence of our venture partners is typically something other than technology. Coupled with our deep experience, that core competence is what makes the new business likely to succeed. Technology plays a major role as well, but our partners have the industry experience and customer connections to build the right stuff and drive growth. That's why we need our venture partners to be successful, and why they need us. It just works for everyone.

<p>
The founders of SLP Toolkit came to us with an idea. Their app would allow school-based speech language pathologists to better manage their time and improve the quality of their services. SLP Toolkit allows you to be the very best version of you. This core purpose centered around improving efficiency was the catalyst for a great app. "Be your /best/" is the mantra of this web app that is transforming the work day for SLP's everywhere.
</p>
<p>
This didn't happen all at once. With the help of our technology and business experience, the founders of SLP Toolkit have worked tirelessly to promote the company, get feedback, and validate their ideas. The result was a successful launch, over 10K user signups, and over 3K paying customers in just a few years. The idea has turned into a thriving and sustainable company which is already making a positive impact on the local economy, and on your school's SLPs too!

<p>
The founders of Parts Detect wanted to make life easier for mechanics. The app allows automotive repair professionals and enthusiasts to find aftermarket and OEM parts within seconds. Just scan the vehicle's VIN barcode and search on a part to see location, warranty, and availability from different venders. The app eliminates time-consuming searches and vehicle matching by automating the end-to-end process.
</p>
<p>
However, uniting large part vendors in this fractured industry to display inventory in a good way posed a daunting technical challenge. There is no standard to match parts with vehicle year/make/model, and each vendor has it's own search interface, so integration of multiple sources is a challenge to say the least. With our experienced guidance to stand on, the Parts Detect founders have successfully on-boarded three major national vendors with more in the works. Over 750 mechanics have signed up to give the app a whirl, and the system processes over $6K worth of orders each month as we roll through pilot testing. Good things are around the corner as we grow this app!

<p>
Setlister is the newest addition to the venture partner family at Boundless. The founders had been thinking about a way for music fans to request songs from bands at live shows for quite some time, and finally found a way to make it happen with us. With mobile payments touching just about every part of our lives, we're on a mission to bring song-requesting power to fans at every live show in the country! With the extensive music background and industry connections held by the founders, this app is sure to make a splash with bands everywhere. The Setlister app has been recently released in beta, so be sure and let your favorite performing musicians know about it!
