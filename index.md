      It takes more than a great technology idea to build a great company. An
      idea is a catalyst, but great companies turn that idea into a sustainable
      business model. Sustainable companies focus on revenue from day one, they
      aspire to delight customers, grow in a controlled way, and improve
      economies long term. We think sustainable companies are a great place to
      invest our time and money, so that's what we do.

        >We've been building apps with early-stage companies for over a decade,
        and we've got the processes nailed down pretty well. If you're starting
        a business around a web or mobile app, we can get your budding company
        off the ground. We've got a couple different programs to do that,
        depending on the stage you're in:<br /><br />
      </span>
      <span class="span2">Newbie</span>
      <span class="span3">
        <br />If you're just getting started and need expert guidance, then some
        consulting help will whip your idea into shape. We'll define your target
        market, their problem/solution set, and the pricing to complete your
        offer. A little bit of planning and validation goes a long way to ensure
        you're building an app that people want.<br /><br

        already, or have done the customer discovery yourself, you might be a
        great fit to partner with us. We invest time, money, or both with the
        right type type of early-stage company. To find out if yours qualifies,
