That’s our why. It's the company purpose we penned over a decade ago, and it hasn’t changed since. Admittedly, the wording is a bit stuffy, but the core idea is spot-on. It’s the reason we love getting up in the morning, and it is the fuel behind everything we do. We love to create meaningful things, and there is something special about building apps that people use and love every day.

Everyone needs a core purpose. During the early stages of business, a core purpose helps to make both the big decisions and the little ones day-to-day. A common purpose helps to form lasting relationships with vendors, business partners, and employees. It's the basis for a company's culture, and gets everyone working toward common goals for a common reason.
