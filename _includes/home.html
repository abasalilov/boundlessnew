    It takes more than a great technology idea to build a great company. An idea
    is a catalyst, but great companies turn that idea into a sustainable
    business model. Sustainable companies focus on revenue from day one, they
    aspire to delight customers, grow in a controlled way, and improve economies
    long term. We think sustainable companies are a great place to invest our
    time and money, so that's what we do.

      >We've been building apps with early-stage companies for over a decade,
      and we've got the processes nailed down pretty well. If you're starting a
      business around a web or mobile app, we can get your budding company off
      the ground. We've got a couple different programs to do that, depending on

      ><br />If you're just getting started and need expert guidance, then some
      consulting help will whip your idea into shape. We'll define your target
      market, their problem/solution set, and the pricing to complete your
      offer. A little bit of planning and validation goes a long way to ensure
      you're building an app that people want.<br /><br /></span

      already, or have done the customer discovery yourself, you might be a
      great fit to partner with us. We invest time, money, or both with the
      right type type of early-stage company. To find out if yours qualifies,
