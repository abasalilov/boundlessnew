      tech pieces are a black box. It seems as though every technology expert

    <div class="aventurepartnershi1">
      A venture partnership is our term for an early-stage company that enters
      into a partnership with us to build a technology company. We all invest
      effort, cash, or both while sharing company equity to create an amazing
      product together. We use a simple operating agreement to govern the
      relationship, and we offer equity buy-back guarantees to make sure
      founders get to keep the lion's share of equity in their pocket.<br /><br />We
      like the term venture partnership when compared with "ventures" or
      "partners". We're not professional investors offering convertible notes or
      SAFE agreements like venture firms. Nor are we service providers that
      over-use the term partner to describe work-for-hire relationships.
      Instead, we invest time &amp; money while sharing risk with company
      founders to become true partners in a business venture. In doing so, we
      provide the tech and business experience, and we leverage founder
      connections and hustle to get a win for everyone.<br /><br />Although we
      use the term technology company, the core competence of our venture
      partners is typically something other than technology. Coupled with our
      deep experience, that core competence is what makes the new business
      likely to succeed. Technology plays a major role as well, but our partners
      have the industry experience and customer connections to build the right
      stuff and drive growth. That's why we need our venture partners to be
      successful, and why they need us. It just works for everyone.

      The founders of SLP Toolkit came to us with an idea. Their app would allow
      school-based speech language pathologists to better manage their time and
      improve the quality of their services. SLP Toolkit allows you to be the
      very best version of you. This core purpose centered around improving
      efficiency was the catalyst for a great app. "Be your /best/" is the
      mantra of this web app that is transforming the work day for SLP's
      everywhere.<br /><br />This didn't happen all at once. With the help of
      our technology and business experience, the founders of SLP Toolkit have
      worked tirelessly to promote the company, get feedback, and validate their
      ideas. The result was a successful launch, over 10K user signups, and over
      3K paying customers in just a few years. The idea has turned into a
      thriving and sustainable company which is already making a positive impact
      on the local economy, and on your school's SLPs too!

      The founders of Parts Detect wanted to make life easier for mechanics. The
      app allows automotive repair professionals and enthusiasts to find
      aftermarket and OEM parts within seconds. Just scan the vehicle's VIN
      barcode and search on a part to see location, warranty, and availability
      from different venders. The app eliminates time-consuming searches and
      vehicle matching by automating the end-to-end process.<br /><br />However,
      uniting large part vendors in this fractured industry to display inventory
      in a good way posed a daunting technical challenge. There is no standard
      to match parts with vehicle year/make/model, and each vendor has it's own
      search interface, so integration of multiple sources is a challenge to say
      the least. With our experienced guidance to stand on, the Parts Detect
      founders have successfully on-boarded three major national vendors with
      more in the works. Over 750 mechanics have signed up to give the app a
      whirl, and the system processes over $6K worth of orders each month as we
      roll through pilot testing. Good things are around the corner as we grow
      this app!
